## Filing Issues and Feature Requests

The guidelines for issues are as follows: **don't be shy**.  As much detail as possible is always welcome, but issue volume around here is pretty low, so it's not a real burden to address stuff even if it's accidentally a dupe or needs some follow-up questions.

## Contributing Code

### Coding Guidelines

The coding guidelines are pretty simple:

* Write tests surrounding your change
* Ensure that all existing tests pass with your change
* Generally keep it clean and follow the coding style of the existing code

### Pull Requests

* To submit a change, just follow the standard fork/code/pull-request Github workflow
* Feel free to submit pulls marked "WIP" (Work in progress) to get early feedback and help
